# Farfetch Full Stack Challenge

Within Marketing at Farfetch we are presented with a wide range of requests which cover different technology stacks, please use this as a showcase to demonstrate your skills and more importantly enjoy the challenges!

## Part 1

The following [link](https://www.farfetch.com/uk/plpslice/listing-api/query?setId=9645&view=180&gender=Men) is a REST API endpoint which contains real-time data for our New In Menswear Set.

Please create a JS application which will output products from this feed. Output these products with images; 2 column for mobile and 3 for tablet/desktop using the breakpoint 960px.

Bonus points for:
- Including designer name, description, anchor and hover image of product.
- Add a filter which allows the user to select the brands available within the feed.
- Packaging this as a build.

## Part 2

Using the same endpoint please create a JS application which pulls in the first 10 products and identifies the prominent colour of each item of clothing. The output of this should be a JSON file which contains and array of products listing the product name, designer, description, link, image path and colour.

Please create your own repo with your submission and provide basic documentation for running builds etc.
